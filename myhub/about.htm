					<p>This Bavarian style Dutchtown Landmark with its timber and stucco construction, steeply 
					pitched roof and corner turret began its journey at the behest of another St. Louis institutionâ€¦Anhueser-Busch.  					  
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Built in 1913 by Anhueser-Busch, it was christened Busch's Gretchen Inn.  Adolphus Busch wanted to show the 
					prohibition movement that beer could be served in a respectable family establishment instead of the typical 
					sawdust floor saloon. 
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Your current hosts are longtime Dutchtowners, Sue and Marty Luepker, who took on the daunting task of 
					renovating and furnishing the landmark in 1993 after Anhueser-Busch donated the property to the Dutchtown South 
					Neighborhood Association.  The Feasting Fox is the symbol of hospitality that graces the side of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery.
					</p>
					<br/>
					<p>In 2001 the building received its long overdue Historic Landmark status.
